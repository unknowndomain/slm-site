# South London Makerspace Membership Management Service

This is a web service that allows users to become members of the South London Makerspace and manage their membership.

The aim was to make it modular so that other spaces can fork it and make use of it for their own meals and share the code with other spaces.

This part of the service in particular is a loader of modules and apps that can be used more widely with few changes.

## Setup
Setup is pretty straightforward. Clone the repo then use the following commands to download all of the submodules that contain the apps.

    git submodule init 
    git submodule update
    
Then run:

    npm update
    node server.js

### OpenShift
This web service is built to work with although doesn't require OpenShift -- a free PaaS service from Red Hat. OpenShift uses Git to load the app, once you create the app with Node and your preferred database in use these instructions to load it in to the server:

    git remote add openshift -f <openshift-git-repo-url>
    git merge openshift/master -s recursive -X ours
    git push openshift HEAD
    
Don't forget to push again when you want to try it out and push back to your github fork if you want to save it.
